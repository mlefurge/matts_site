            <h3> stash </h3>
            <p>  </p>
            <p> Stash is a mobile friendly web application built with Ruby on Rails. With stash, you can swipe through pictures of food taken at restaurants in your area. If the food looks delicious to you, swipe the photo to your stash. Information about the food depicted in each photo is available. </p>
            <p> Stash uses Google Maps and Places APIs to auto-populate important information, such as the name of the restaurant where the food was served, the location of the restaurant, and the price range of the dish. </p>
            <p> If you are on your mobile device, you have the option to take photos of food (must be from a restaurant), tag the location and details of the food and upload the photo to the application so others have the option to add it to their stash. </p>
